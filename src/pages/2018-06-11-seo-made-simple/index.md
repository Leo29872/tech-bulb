<p>Hi. In this post I will try to share some tips for better positioning of the site, which you should consider on your site and which I learned in the last time. If we want to create something valuable, we must make as many people as possible to know our vision, the product – we have to take care of SEO.</p>

<h3>Take care of the page speed and security</h3>
<p>We live in quite stressful times. We have learned not to waste time waiting, we are always looking for the fastest and the best way. The same happens on the web. We do not have time to wait longer for the page to load, in this situation we are looking for a different source. When creating a website, you need to ensure good speed and security of the site – install the ssl certificate. Try to put target = “_blank” in links to external websites that open addresses in new browser tabs to avoid losing users browsing your page at any given time.</p>

<h3>Pay attention to responsiveness</h3>
<p>This is already some kind of standard – your website must look good on different devices and resolutions. A large part of the view of your website will come from mobile devices. According to the latest statistics, mobile versions of websites have more views than desktop versions. This should not be underestimated.</p>

<h3>Add images and links</h3>
<p>Adding images are good for SEO if you know how to do it correctly. Add keywords to your page by adding keywords. Your content will be better if you enter addresses that lead to other articles.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>Always add keywords to your entries. It’s worth adding a meta description to the URL and modifying the address. Instead of using a URL similar to test.com/1242332, you should change it to a more intuitive one, for example test.com/seo-advices.</p>

<h3>Using the correct tags</h3>
<p>Use the appropriate tags (h1, h2…) to mark the hierarchy of information on the page. Sometimes we forget about that in our developer’s job(quick deadlines, etc.), we make changes only in style sheets, but keep it in mind (I forget about that hierarchy really often, I’m not the robot).</p>

<h3>Add SEO plugins</h3>
<p>I recommend installing the Yoast SEO plugin. It will help you work on SEO by suggesting changes on the site. I think it’s an essential plugin if you own WordPress website. I don’t like overuse plugins, if I need something I try to build plugin on my own, but there is plugin which is truly valueable(I’ll make a post about that plugins in the future.</p>

It is very difficult to create a site that is both user-friendly and for index engines. These few steps will help you improve the SEO of your website. If you have other proven methods – share with us in the comment under this post.</p>

<p>Bye, have a superb day.</p>
